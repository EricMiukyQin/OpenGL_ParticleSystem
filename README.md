DESCRIPTION: The project is named Particle Carnival. We implement particle simulation to create firework 
             effects. In detail, each lighting components generated after the exposion is treated as a particle
             object. To form different patterns, particles in each pattern have different initial speed, which
             is a vector. Use mouse position to control camera angle and WASD to move. To reload firworks, 
             press "reload" button.
